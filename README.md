# Airbnb Clone Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a full-stack Airbnb clone with a robust backend system. The goal is to create a scalable platform for property rentals with features like user management, property listings, bookings, reviews, and secure payments. The backend will be built using Django and PostgreSQL, following RESTful API principles.

## Team Roles and Responsibilities
### Backend Developer
- Designs and implements API endpoints
- Develops core application logic
- Integrates with database and third-party services

### Database Administrator
- Designs and optimizes database schema
- Manages data migrations
- Ensures data integrity and security

### DevOps Engineer
- Configures deployment pipelines
- Manages cloud infrastructure
- Implements monitoring and logging

### Security Specialist
- Implements authentication/authorization
- Ensures compliance with security standards
- Conducts vulnerability assessments

## Technology Stack
- **Django**: Web framework for building RESTful APIs
- **MYSQL**: Relational database for structured data storage
- **GraphQL**: Alternative API layer for efficient data querying
- **Redis**: Caching and real-time functionality
- **Celery**: Asynchronous task processing
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent environments
- **AWS**: Cloud hosting and scalable infrastructure

## Database Design
### Key Entities
**Users**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `email` (Unique)
- `password_hash`
- `created_at`
- Relationships: One-to-Many with Properties, Bookings, Reviews

**Properties**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `title`
- `price_per_night`
- `host_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `location`
- Relationships: One-to-Many with Bookings, Reviews

**Bookings**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key to Properties)
- `guest_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `start_date`
- `end_date`

**Reviews**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key to Properties)
- `author_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `rating`
- `comment`

**Payments**
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key to Bookings)
- `amount`
- `status`

## Feature Breakdown
### User Management
Handles registration, authentication, and profile management. Ensures secure access to platform features through JWT authentication.

### Property Management
Allows hosts to create, update, and delete property listings. Includes media uploads and availability calendars.

### Booking System
Manages reservation lifecycle from inquiry to completion. Handles date conflicts and pricing calculations.

### Review System
Enables guests to leave ratings and comments. Implements moderation tools for content quality.

### Payment Processing
Integrates with payment gateways for secure transactions. Manages refunds and payment verification.

## API Security
### Key Security Measures
- **Authentication**: JWT-based token system for user verification
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) for endpoint protection
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute-force attacks and API abuse
- **Data Encryption**: TLS for transit, AES-256 for sensitive data at rest

### Security Critical Areas
- **User Data**: Protects PII through encryption and access controls
- **Payments**: PCI-DSS compliance for financial transactions
- **Admin Systems**: Multi-factor authentication for privileged access
- **APIs**: Input validation to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks

## CI/CD Pipeline
### Overview
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment automates testing and deployment processes. Ensures code quality and enables rapid, reliable releases.

### Implementation
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing on pull requests
- **Docker Containers**: Consistent environments across stages
- **AWS CodeDeploy**: Zero-downtime production deployments
- **Sentry**: Real-time error monitoring

### Benefits
- Early bug detection through automated testing
- Reduced manual deployment errors
- Faster release cycles
- Rollback capabilities for failed deployments
